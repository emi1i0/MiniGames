# Pizza Express

A Paperboy-style endless delivery runner in **Three.js**, set in a golden-hour
suburb ("Cheesetown"). You ride a red delivery scooter down an endless street:
**steer left/right to dodge road hazards** (instant death on contact) and **throw
pizzas at roadside mailboxes** that have a pending order (marked by a bright
downward **arrow**). A throw is delivered to the customer **on the side of the
street the scooter is on**; a throw with no customer in range on that side is an
**errant pizza** that costs you a token. Deliveries score points with a **combo
multiplier**. During the 10-second tutorial a **shield** (shown top-left) cushions
errant throws; once the tutorial ends the shield is gone and you run on **3 pizza
tokens** — waste all three and the run ends. (Letting a customer pass unserved only
breaks the combo, it costs no token.) It is a single infinite level whose speed,
hazard density and customer pace
**ramp fast** after a 10-second tutorial. It is **PC-oriented** (keyboard; no
touch button). Solo score is total points (higher is better, default board). Art
direction: `DESIGN.md` ("Golden Hour Delivery"), based on the game's cover.

## Coordinate system

The road runs along **Z**. The scooter stays near `z = 0` while the world scrolls
toward the camera (**+Z**); obstacles and mailboxes spawn far ahead (negative Z)
and travel toward `+Z` (same convention as Space Rush / `vector-rush`). Y is up,
the road surface is `y = 0`. The scooter only moves in **X** (steering).

## Module layout

- `main.ts` — entry point, mounts `Game` into `#app`.
- `game/Game.ts` — orchestrates scene/camera/renderer/composer and the
  `ready → countdown → playing → gameover` loop (`tick`). Owns the warm
  golden-hour lights, the **chase camera** (behind + above, easing its X toward
  the scooter — `applyCamera`), the difficulty ramp (`difficulty()`, stepped),
  scoring + combo, throwing (`handleThrow`) and delivery (`deliver`), and the
  crash juice (dust/tomato particle burst, warm `crashFlash` PointLight, camera
  shake, hidden scooter, game-over overlay **deferred 600 ms**).
- `game/Street.ts` — the environment: the **road + dirt shoulders** scroll their
  canvas-texture UV for an endless surface (the moving dashes are the speed cue),
  while the **grass stays still** (a sliding grass sheet looked cheap — flat green
  detail moving reads as the surface itself sliding). The grass is a **flat solid
  green with no texture at all**: any pattern on it — fine speckle and big soft
  mottling were both tried — has no stable landmark at the grazing camera angle,
  so the surrounding motion perceptually drags it along ("motion capture"
  illusion) and the static grass *looks* like it slides with the road; that
  illusion, not any actual scrolling, was the bug behind "el pasto se mueve".
  Featureless, the surface cannot read as moving, and all motion over it comes
  from **discrete objects passing**: besides the house clusters, `buildMeadow`
  fills the field beyond the house line (`|x| >= MEADOW_MIN_X` = 13, so the two
  pools never overlap) with **little trees + bushes** (shared geometry /
  materials) on their own denser Z grid, pushed into the same wrapping-cluster
  pool so they stream past exactly like the houses (fixed-in-world meadow decor
  was tried too — props frozen mid-field while the town flows past read even
  worse than the sliding-grass illusion). Besides, a broken row of
  raised **bushes** (`buildHedgeBorder`) runs along the road/grass boundary as a
  clear **separation**; being distinct 3-D clumps with gaps, they read as objects
  *passing* as they scroll, and together with the **wrapping pool** of roadside
  props (cottages, trees, hedges, fences, warm lamp posts) they carry the sense of
  motion. Plus a static dusk sky (gradient dome, low sun + halo, drifting clouds, a
  hill silhouette baked into the sky texture). Purely decorative.
- `game/Scooter.ts` — the player: a primitive red scooter + rider (red cap,
  delivery box on the rear rack) cel-shaded; X steering with velocity smoothing,
  lean + yaw into turns, engine idle bob, spinning wheels, a headlight. Exposes
  `throwOrigin()` (world point a pizza launches from).
- `game/Obstacle.ts` + `game/ObstacleField.ts` — road hazards (cone, pothole,
  trashcan, crate, **car** = a car parked parallel to the road (long in Z: it is
  the only kind with a `halfLength`, so collision keeps testing while it
  straddles the scooter's plane, nose to tail, instead of the usual single
  centre-crossing frame), and the **dog** = the one *dynamic*
  hazard), all **instant-death**. `ObstacleField` spawns gap-based rows that always
  leave a **guaranteed clear gap** the scooter can reach (see "Fairness" below);
  static obstacles go *outside* the gap. A dog instead spawns as its own **patrol
  row** (`spawnDog`): a lone dog that trots across the whole street, reversing at
  the verges (`Obstacle.setPatrol`), dodged by **timing** rather than by a gap.
- `game/Mailbox.ts` + `game/MailboxField.ts` — customers. A `Mailbox` floats a
  bright bouncing **down-arrow** over it while `pending` (clearer than the old
  pizza icon); delivery flips its flag up. It carries a `reserved` flag set when a
  pizza is in flight toward it, so it is **not** counted as a miss mid-flight. The
  field spawns them along the verges, tracks pending ones, reports **misses**
  (passed unserved), and exposes `nearestPendingTarget(side)` — the closest
  pending, unreserved customer **on that side** in range, or null (an errant throw).
- `game/Pizza.ts` — `PizzaThrower`: a pool of pizzas that **lob on a parabola**
  from the scooter toward the assigned pending mailbox (**homing** on the moving
  box), delivering on arrival via an `onDeliver` callback. A throw with no valid
  customer arcs to the verge and fizzles.
- `game/Particles.ts` — one additive point-cloud pool for cosmetic bursts (crash
  dust + delivery cheese-gold sparkle). Gravity + drag + colour fade.
- `game/InputController.ts` — steering (`dirX`, -1..1) from A/D + arrows or a
  pointer drag, plus **throw** edge-events from Space/W/Up/J/K and a quick tap on
  the canvas (a tap = throw, a drag = steer).
- `game/Hud.ts` — DOM overlay: score + **combo** + best, the **miss-token strip**
  (a cool inline-SVG shield + 3 warm pizza tokens, spent ones greyed), the tutorial
  **thought bubble** (above the character, with a down-tail), start/game-over
  screens (two titles: crash vs "perdiste muchos pedidos"), countdown label, and
  the leaderboard panel. No throw button (PC-oriented).
- `game/SoundEffects.ts` — synthesized Web Audio (countdown tick, throw whoosh,
  delivery ding whose pitch rises with the combo, miss blip, crash), no assets.
  Plus the **2-stroke moped engine loop**: a persistent node graph (two detuned
  saws at the firing rate + band-passed exhaust noise amplitude-chopped at that
  same rate + a slow LFO putter), started by `startEngine()` in `startGame`,
  revved via `setEngineSpeed(t)` each playing tick (t = normalized travel speed,
  so the pitch climbs with the ramp), and cut by `stopEngine()` in `endGame`
  (both the crash and the out-of-pizzas endings) and in `beginCountdown` (safety
  for room-mode round restarts). `setEngineSpeed` skips sub-1.5% changes so the
  per-frame calls don't flood the automation timeline.
- `game/toon.ts` — cel-shading helpers: a cached stepped `gradientMap`, `toonMat`
  (a `MeshToonMaterial` factory) and `glowMat` (unlit / additive glow for
  markers, sun, sparks).
- `game/dotTexture.ts` — cached soft round sprite for the particles.
- `game/constants.ts` — **all tunable values** (road/field, speeds, difficulty
  ramp, `TUTORIAL_SECONDS`, `MISS_PIZZAS`, obstacle pacing + gap, mailbox pacing,
  throwing, scoring, palette). Tune here first.

## Core loop

- **Dodge:** the scooter (X only) must avoid every hazard. A single touch ends the
  run (instant death, like Space Rush / Cannon Dodge).
- **Deliver:** press throw (Space / W / ↑, or a canvas tap) and a pizza auto-lobs
  to the closest pending mailbox **on the side the scooter is on** (`scooter.x`
  sign) within `THROW_RANGE_Z` ahead. Delivery = `DELIVERY_BASE_POINTS × combo`;
  the combo climbs (capped at `COMBO_MAX`) with each delivery. Throw has a
  `THROW_COOLDOWN`. So positioning matters: to serve a left customer, be on the
  left half — this is what the second tutorial hint teaches.
- **Errant throw = the token cost.** A throw with **no deliverable customer on the
  scooter's side in range** is wasted: it **resets the combo to 0 and spends a
  token** (decided at throw time in `handleThrow` → `onErrantPizza`, so spamming is
  punished). The **shield** (`shieldActive`) is a *tutorial-only* cushion that
  absorbs the first errant throw and **disappears when the tutorial ends**
  (`updateTutorial`); errant throws are otherwise **free during the tutorial**. In
  the real game each errant throw costs a pizza (`pizzasLeft`, from `MISS_PIZZAS`)
  and running out ends the run (game over, "misses" reason) — the second failure
  mode besides crashing. **A customer that passes unserved only breaks the combo**
  (`onCustomerMissed`), no token.
- **Tutorial (first `TUTORIAL_SECONDS`):** a gentle intro — **no lethal
  obstacles**, two thought-bubble hints (throw controls, then "position yourself on
  the side you want to throw to"), and errant throws are **free** (only the shield
  can be spent, never a pizza, and it can't end the run). When the tutorial ends the
  shield vanishes and the speed + difficulty ramp start (`playT = elapsed −
  TUTORIAL_SECONDS`).
- **Score** = total points (deliveries × combo). Higher is better, default board.

## Non-obvious decisions

**Fairness — the gap is always reachable.** `ObstacleField.spawnRow` picks a safe
gap `[gapX ± gapHalf]` whose centre drifts from the previous row by at most the
scooter's reachable travel (`SCOOTER_MOVE_SPEED × spacing/speed ×
GAP_REACH_FACTOR`), and shrinks with difficulty. Obstacles are placed **only
outside** that gap (`place()` confines each prop's full width to a blocked side
region), so the clear path is never blocked and never jumps farther than you can
steer — hard but never luck. A row adds a second obstacle on the other side with
growing odds (`DOUBLE_OBSTACLE_CHANCE_MAX`), and cars only spawn in regions wide
enough to fit one with margin (the `pickKind` gate).

**The dog is the dynamic obstacle.** Every other hazard is static and placed
outside the row's clear gap; the dog instead trots across the full road width
(`DOG_SPEED_*`, growing with `d`) as the *only* hazard in its row. It stays fair
because collision is only tested the single frame it reaches the scooter's Z, its
band is narrow (`HALF_WIDTH.dog`), and its patrol speed is far below the scooter's
— so from anywhere you only need to sidestep its band as it arrives. Dog rows
don't touch `prevGapX`, so gap continuity for the surrounding static rows is
preserved, and the small sidestep keeps you near that gap line. `DOG_ROW_CHANCE_*`
tunes how often they appear.

**Difficulty is a stepped function of play time.** `Game.difficulty(playT)`
quantizes **post-tutorial** play time into levels (`DIFFICULTY_STEP_SECONDS`) so
the game visibly steps up, reaching its hardest values at `DIFFICULTY_RAMP_SECONDS`
(~60 s) then holding. It drives obstacle spacing, gap width, double-obstacle odds
and mailbox spacing. The travel **speed** ramps continuously (`BASE_SPEED →
MAX_SPEED`) off the same `playT`, and is held at `BASE_SPEED` during the tutorial.

**Throwing is a short lob, not a snipe.** `THROW_RANGE_Z` is deliberately short so
you deliver as a customer comes alongside (Paperboy timing), and the pizza homes
on the mailbox's *current* position each frame so it lands even though the box is
moving toward you.

**Delivery vs errant is decided at throw time.** `handleThrow` picks the target on
the scooter's side; if one exists it is `reserved` (so it can't be marked missed
mid-flight) and the pizza delivers on arrival; if none, the throw is errant and
`onErrantPizza` runs immediately (token cost + combo break), while the pizza just
flops to the verge for show. Deciding at throw time avoids a mid-flight target
passing you and double-counting as both a miss and an errant.

**Auto-start / idle drift.** On the menus and during the countdown the street
keeps scrolling (idle `street.scroll`) so the town is never frozen; obstacles run
with an off-road scooter X (`999`) so nothing "collides" while idle.

**Enter-to-start countdown.** From the start / game-over screen, Enter / Space or
a tap enters a `countdown` state showing 3 / 2 / 1 / YA (`COUNTDOWN_LABELS`,
`COUNTDOWN_STEP` s each) with the shared 750 Hz tick before play begins. Space
serves double duty: on the menus it starts (via `Hud`'s activate); while playing
`Game.handleActivate` ignores it (already playing) and it throws instead (via
`InputController`). Mandatory shared pattern (see root `CLAUDE.md`).

**Warm-only rendering.** `MeshToonMaterial` (cel bands) for props, `ACESFilmic`
tone mapping, and **gentle high-threshold bloom** so only the sun, order markers
and pizzas glow — not the whole warm scene. Fog is a peachy haze. No cold colours
anywhere (see DESIGN.md).

## Room mode (multiplayer)

Wired to the shared party mode: the constructor calls `initRoomMode("pizza-express",
{ getScore: () => this.score, onStart: () => this.beginCountdown() })`. `getScore`
is the live points for the timeout partial. With `?room=` in the URL the game-over
reports the score to the room instead of the global ranking, the restart input is
blocked (one run per round), and `onStart` auto-runs the countdown so everyone
starts together. Whoever scores the most points wins the round. Without the param
nothing changes.
